# Philo
### Intro
This is a project from 42 Ecole. The aim is to learn the basics of threads:
- Init threads
- Use of mutex
- Manage having multiple threads running at the same time

This is a well known exercise in Software. The rules are simple:
There is a round table with philosophers. Each one will eat, sleep and think. 

> When they try to eat, they need _two forks_. One from the left and one from the right.

> If one philo takes the forks, the philos around him cannot take the forks he is using to eat.

> Every philo has a time to die. If they don't eat in that given time, they'll die


This is one of my oldest projects in 42. I upload it to gihub because I really liked it. So, I want to have it here :D
